# Exercise 2: Simple Sums 
"""In this exercise, you will create and work with integer variables,
 perform arithmetic operations, and print the result to the console."""
# Steps of the question
"""1. Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value `8`.
2. Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value `10`.
3. Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
4. Print the value of the sum to the console."""

# Step of Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value 10.
Number02=10
# Step of Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
Total_Sum =Number01 + Number02
# Step of Print the value of the sum to the console.".

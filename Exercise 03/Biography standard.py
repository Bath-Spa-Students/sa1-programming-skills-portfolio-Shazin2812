#Steps:
"""1. Store the information (name, hometown, and age) as key-value pairs in a
dictionary.
2. Print the values on separate lines using a single print() statement.
3. Use variables with appropriate data types for each piece of information."""

# Storing information as key-value pairs in a dictionary
person_information = {
    "name": "Shazin",
    "hometown": "Sharjah",
    "age": 18}

# Checking if the values on separate lines in a single print statement
print(f"Name: {person_information['name']}\nHometown: {person_information['hometown']}\nAge: {person_information['age']}")
